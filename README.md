# ChallengeEpicSpies:
I found this to be Challenging, I ocurred several coding error behind the scene.
I attempt to correct them and later decided it was easier to rebuild and rebuild and rebuild.

Initial directions were given to imply using TimeSpan Method,
I was bemused by all the examples I attempt to insert in my code.
I have said before, I made so many errors ...I should be just fine when I hit them again.

One thing I did appreciate ... 
Last rebuild I realized by:
Keeping the output window open to show errors as you type each letter of the code.
It will save you a lifeTime :}
